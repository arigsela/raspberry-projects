Raspberry Pi 5 PWM LED Brightness Control

This program demonstrates Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) for LED brightness control
on Raspberry Pi 5. Since Pi 5's gpiod doesn't have built-in PWM support,
we implement software PWM using threading.

PWM Concepts:
- Frequency: How many on/off cycles per second (Hz)
- Duty Cycle: Percentage of time the signal is HIGH (0-100%)
- Period: Total time for one complete cycle (1/frequency)

Hardware setup:
- LED connected to GPIO17 (pin 11) with a 330Î© resistor to GND
- Optional: Button on GPIO27 for mode switching

Key concepts demonstrated:

1. Software PWM Implementation:
   - Uses threading for consistent timing
   - Separate thread generates PWM signal
   - Thread-safe duty cycle updates

2. PWM Theory:
   - Frequency determines flicker perception
   - Duty cycle controls average power/brightness
   - Higher frequency = smoother control

3. Python Threading:
   - Threading module for concurrent execution
   - Lock for thread synchronization
   - Daemon threads for clean shutdown

4. Animation Patterns:
   - State persistence using function attributes
   - Mathematical functions for smooth animations
   - Different visual effects showcase PWM versatility

Note: For production use, consider hardware PWM pins or
kernel PWM drivers for better performance and accuracy.
