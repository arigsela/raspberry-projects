Raspberry Pi 5 Hello World - LED Blink with Button Control

This is your first Raspberry Pi 5 Python program! It demonstrates:
- Controlling an LED (output)
- Reading a button press (input)
- Using the gpiod library for Pi 5 compatibility

The gpiod library is the modern way to control GPIO on Raspberry Pi,
replacing the older RPi.GPIO which doesn't work on Pi 5.

Hardware connections:
- LED: GPIO17 (pin 11) -> 330Î© resistor -> LED -> GND
- Button: GPIO27 (pin 13) -> Button -> GND

Key Concepts Explained:

1. gpiod Library:
   - Modern GPIO control for Linux
   - Works with Pi 5's new RP1 chip
   - Object-oriented interface

2. GPIO Chip:
   - Represents the GPIO hardware
   - Pi 5 uses "gpiochip4" 
   - Must be opened before use

3. GPIO Lines:
   - Individual pins on the chip
   - Can be configured as input or output
   - Support various flags (pull-up, pull-down, etc.)

4. Pull-up Resistor:
   - Keeps input at HIGH (1) when not connected
   - Button press connects to GND, making it LOW (0)
   - Prevents floating input issues

5. Event Loop:
   - Continuously checks inputs
   - Responds to state changes
   - Small sleep prevents 100% CPU usage

Common Issues:
- Permission denied: Run with sudo or add user to gpio group
- Chip not found: Make sure you're on Pi 5
- LED doesn't light: Check polarity (long leg is positive)
